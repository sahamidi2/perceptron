# Perceptron Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the **Perceptron** algorithm in Python. The perceptron is one of the most fundamental building blocks in neural networks and forms the basis of many machine learning models. This script was developed as part of a problem set for a **Deep Learning** class.

## File Structure

- `perceptron.py`: Contains the implementation of the Perceptron model, which is designed to classify data using a linear decision boundary. The file includes functions to:
  - Initialize a perceptron.
  - Train the model on labeled data using gradient descent.
  - Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
